    <h3>Employee Management System</h3>
    <p>
      This was my first full-stack project built from the ground up — a web-based employee management system designed to handle employee records, roles, and company data. It features user authentication, admin/employee role separation, and full CRUD functionality for managing employees and related information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Developed with Python using the Flask framework, structured around RESTful principles</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> Integrated PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and management</li>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and responsive user interface</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Implemented secure login with role-based access control</li>
      <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Used self-guided learning and AI assistance to overcome roadblocks and debug complex logic</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
      <p>
        I built this website from scratch to showcase my background, projects, and journey into software development. It reflects my commitment to continuous learning and serves as a central hub for my work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Utilizes Flask templating for reusable layouts and routes for each section</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Responsive design with a carousel image reel, navigation bar, and project cards</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> A personal site to present my skills, resume, and ongoing growth as a developer</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Hand Signal Recognition System for Construction Safety (In Progress)</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently building a computer vision system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect standardized hand signals used by spotters in construction zones. The goal is to enhance communication and safety when working around heavy machinery.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV</li>
      <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Image classification using CNNs trained on a custom dataset of hand signals</li>
      <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Currently working to improve training accuracy and reduce model overfitting</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Aims to support safer job sites through automated gesture recognition</li>
    </ul>
